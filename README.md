# elcn's dotfiles

**Warning :** Don't blindly use my settings unless you know what you are doing, these could break your setup. Use at your own risk!

# How to install :

Actually, there's no way to install my files automatically, you will need to do it manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2ELCN0168/elcn-dotfiles
cd elcn-dotfiles/.config
```

From here, choose the files you want and copy them to your `$HOME/.config` directory. Make sure to backup YOUR files before doing that, they could be erased by mine!

> [!WARNING]
> This is a work-in-progress repository, your apps may look weird/vanilla/unfinished by installing my files. Don't be surprised and stay up-to-date.
